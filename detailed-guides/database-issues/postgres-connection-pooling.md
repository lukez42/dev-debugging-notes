# PostgreSQL Connection Pooling: Troubleshooting and Optimization

## Problem Overview
PostgreSQL connection pooling issues can lead to performance degradation, connection timeouts, and application crashes. This guide covers how to diagnose, fix, and optimize connection pooling in PostgreSQL, particularly in high-traffic applications.

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL server (version 9.6 or higher)
- Access to PostgreSQL configuration files
- Monitoring tools (pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_statements)
- Application using a connection pool (e.g., PgBouncer, application-level pooling)

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Initial Investigation
- Check current connections:
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
  ```
- Monitor connection errors in logs:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log | grep "connection"
  ```
- Check pool statistics:
  ```sql
  -- For PgBouncer
  SHOW pools;
  SHOW stats;
  ```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
Common causes of connection pooling issues:
1. **Connection Leaks**: Connections not properly closed
2. **Pool Exhaustion**: Too many concurrent connections
3. **Timeout Settings**: Inappropriate connection timeouts
4. **Resource Limits**: System limits (ulimit) too low
5. **Application Design**: Poor connection management

### 3. Solution Implementation
```bash
# 1. Configure PgBouncer (if using)
# /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
mydb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 20
min_pool_size = 5
reserve_pool_size = 5
reserve_pool_timeout = 3
max_db_connections = 50
max_user_connections = 50
server_idle_timeout = 600
server_reset_query = DISCARD ALL
```

```python
# 2. Application-level connection pool (Python example)
from psycopg2 import pool

connection_pool = pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
    minconn=5,
    maxconn=20,
    host="localhost",
    database="mydb",
    user="myuser",
    password="mypassword",
    connect_timeout=3
)

def get_connection():
    try:
        return connection_pool.getconn()
    except pool.PoolError:
        # Handle pool exhaustion
        raise ConnectionError("Connection pool exhausted")
    finally:
        # Always return connection to pool
        connection_pool.putconn(conn)
```

### 4. Verification
- Monitor connection pool health:
  ```sql
  -- Check active connections
  SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
  
  -- Check connection age
  SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start) as duration
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state = 'active';
  
  -- Check pool statistics
  SHOW pools;
  SHOW stats;
  ```

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Application-Level Pooling**
   - Pros: More control, application-specific optimization
   - Cons: More complex to implement, less efficient
   - When to use: Simple applications, specific requirements

2. **PgBouncer**
   - Pros: Efficient, transparent to application
   - Cons: Additional component to maintain
   - When to use: High-traffic applications, multiple clients

3. **Connection Pooling in ORM**
   - Pros: Framework integration, easier implementation
   - Cons: Less control, framework-specific
   - When to use: Using ORM frameworks (SQLAlchemy, Django)

## Prevention and Best Practices
1. **Connection Management**
   - Always use connection pooling
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Monitor connection usage

2. **Configuration**
   - Set appropriate pool sizes
   - Configure connection timeouts
   - Enable connection logging
   - Set up monitoring

3. **Application Design**
   - Use connection pooling libraries
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Handle connection errors gracefully
   - Use connection timeouts

## Troubleshooting
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Symptoms: Connection timeouts, "too many connections" errors
   - Solution:
     ```bash
     # Increase pool size
     max_client_conn = 2000
     default_pool_size = 50
     
     # Check for connection leaks
     SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity 
     WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' 
     AND age(now(), query_start) > interval '5 minutes';
     ```

2. **Slow Connection Establishment**
   - Symptoms: High connection latency, timeout errors
   - Solution:
     ```bash
     # Optimize PostgreSQL settings
     tcp_keepalives_idle = 60
     tcp_keepalives_interval = 10
     tcp_keepalives_count = 6
     
     # Check network latency
     ping -c 10 database_host
     ```

3. **Connection Drops**
   - Symptoms: Random disconnections, "connection reset" errors
   - Solution:
     ```bash
     # Adjust timeout settings
     statement_timeout = '30s'
     idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10min'
     
     # Enable connection logging
     log_connections = on
     log_disconnections = on
     ```
